Video 1: Motivation

I learned that a solitary language model is fairly limited and it doesnt have access to tools, external context and mulitistep workflows. So many LLMs use control- flow that consists of pre/ post LLM calls. This control call forms a "chain". I also leaned that the control flow of an agent is defined by an LLM. A Router agent uses an LLM to decide which predefined step to take — it has less control Whereas a Fully Autonomous agent plans and executes all steps on its own — it has more control. I also understood the advantage of using Langraph is to bend the reliability curve ie to maintain reliability even after pushing the level of control given to an LLM.
