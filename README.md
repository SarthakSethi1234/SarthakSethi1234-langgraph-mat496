MODULE 1: 

Video 1: Motivation

I learned that a solitary language model is fairly limited and it doesnt have access to tools, external context and mulitistep workflows. So many LLMs use control- flow that consists of pre/ post LLM calls. This control call forms a "chain". I also leaned that the control flow of an agent is defined by an LLM. A Router agent uses an LLM to decide which predefined step to take — it has less control Whereas a Fully Autonomous agent plans and executes all steps on its own — it has more control. I also understood the advantage of using Langraph is to bend the reliability curve ie to maintain reliability even after pushing the level of control given to an LLM.

Video 2: Simple graph

In this lesson I learned how to build a simple graph and got introduced to the core compoents of a langgraph. The edge between the start and node 1 is called normal edge. When we choe different nodes based on some condition then these edges are known as conditional edges. State is the object that we bass in between the nodes and edges or our graph.

Changes I made:

I made a simple graph in langchain which detects if the user is happy or not and cheers him if he's sad and appreciate him if he's happy.
